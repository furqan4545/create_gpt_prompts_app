This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Motivation

Created this project for fun learning. Shoutout to "Adrian" from Javascript Mastery for teaching this nextjs project in a wonderful way. Now I guess I will be creating my next projects in Nextjs. 

If you want to reach out to me for any reason or to understand any part of code, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/furqan4545/). I won't reply immediately but I will reply for sure. Thanks again to Javascript Mastery for their amazing content and projects.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
